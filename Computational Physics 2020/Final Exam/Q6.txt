The solution is correct because:
1) when number of sampled point on x axis increased beyond N=80, the solution doesn't change , that mean the it has converged to its actual analytical value.
    Here below table list the value of function at end point as function of number of points on which x-axis is sampled.
N	y1	y2
40	0.7376871065	-0.36884355325
80	0.7376871064	-0.36884355323
160	0.7376871064	-0.36884355323
