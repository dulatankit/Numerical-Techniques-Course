Q4(e)
Ans:  1)Since the integration of power spectrum of random numbers gives the statistical variance of the input random array, so by
         calculating the variance using power spectrum and then comparing it with actual value of variance (which can be calculated using library function)
         i can say weather my power spectrum is good enough or not.

         since from code ,variance calculated using power spectrum is 0.050013953261204495, while the actual variance of the random array is 0.08574521038255833.
         The two values are very close to each other, so power spectrum calculated is a good measure of statistics of the input random array.

        2) Also random array is fluctuating in between 0 and 1 for all time, so on large time scales , and variance is very small (0.085) so the function is more or less a constant valued,
	and since the fourier transform of a constant function is dirac delta function, that's what i am getting.
