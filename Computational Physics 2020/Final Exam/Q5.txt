Q5:

Ans: Criteria for choosing a software library for a computational physics task.

1) Review/User experience  : Other people's experiences are useful in indicating the potential  and problems of the software package.

2)Cost : Software cost and its annual maintenance cost, need to be considered when we have 5 options.

3)Efficiency : The one which which runs more efficiently in term of machine time and storage requirements.
	    Better efficiency could be either it uses a good programming language or it has better algorithms to solve the problems.

4) Interface & Integration : Software package should be able to export and import data to and from the other packages of the same kind.
		           e.g. Importing the header files of 'c' in python.

5) Ease of Use: The one which is more user friendly will be preffered.

6) Trend of using the library: It's good if it is commonly used library, that means most people trust on this as well it will be easy 
			in that case to understand your work for others, to whom you share your work.
